This package is an 'unofficial' companion to the textbook [Applied Logistic
Regression (3rd ed., 2013)](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470582472.html) by D.W. Hosmer, S. Lemeshow and
R.X. Sturdivant (3rd ed.).

It includes all the datasets used in the book, both for easy
reproducibility and algorithms benchmarking purposes.

Some analysis proposed in the text are reproduced in the examples,
in order to provide data testing and code demos at the same time.

The vignette includes all the examples (with graphics too); therefore is
organized per-dataset.
